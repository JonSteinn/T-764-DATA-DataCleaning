Identifying by name brings a lot of problems such as typos and conventions. This paper is about the detection of duplicate individuals in an old Icelandic legacy database. We use a distance measure, domain specific string manipulation as well as comparing other fields to detect duplicates. The number of duplicates found amounted to $16.63\%$ of the total rows.
