The script was written in Python using the \href{https://pandas.pydata.org/}{\texttt{pandas}} and \href{https://github.com/life4/textdistance}{\texttt{textdistance}} libraries to create data frames and calculating Levenshtein distance respectively. The assignment of the variables defined in Section \ref{ch:methods} that we used can be seen in Table \ref{tab:varset}.

    \begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c|c|c}
        $T$ & $B$ & $E$ & $P$ & $N$ & $I$  \\
        \hline
        $0.95$ & $0.1$ & $0.15$ & $0.15$ & $0.25$ & $0.25$
    \end{tabular}

The sizes of the groups of duplicates can be seen in Figure \ref{tab:dupgrpsize} but these groups include the original.

The total number of duplicates found was 748. This number is excluding the original rows from each group of connected duplicates. That amounts to $16.63\%$ of all rows.
