It is difficult to measure our success without knowing which rows are duplicates. The grouped rows were skimmed over to see if any false positives had occurred but none were spotted. If that is indeed the case, then any reduction of data without removing information can be considered a success.

Considering this database was in actual use it is quite astonishing it has 14 rows of the same individual. It underlies the need for cleaning data and what problems identifying by name and date of birth can bring.
